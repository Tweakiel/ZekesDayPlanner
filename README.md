## Description üìñ

---

> A simple application that uses Day.js as a third party api. This Scheduler works as follows, Green Rows will be the future/upcoming todos, Red is Current TimeBlock, and Grey timeblocks are the timeblocks that have passed. This Also uses the LocalStorage in the browser, meaning whenever a task is populated to a time block, localStorage dedicated to that timeblock will contain that task and save it.

### LocalStorage Demonstration/Example
